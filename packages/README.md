# Packages

This folder contains all the packages related to the SynTest Core.

## Libraries

Libraries consist of independent pieces of code that the core package uses. These libraries are created such that they can be used for other purposes outside of the SynTest project.

## Plugins

Plugins consist of extensions of the tool which are not necessarily usefull for every type of user.

For a tutorial on how to create plugins please look at [syntest.org](https://www.syntest.org/docs/)
